ARG is the interactive prefix arg, if any. It is passed to the

PROMPT is a string or a function. If a string it used as is as
the prompt to send to OpenAI. If PROMPT is a function it is
called with PROMPT-ARGS to produce the prompt. PROMPT-ARGS is a
key / value style property list.

When the response text is received from OpenAI, ACTION is called
with the property list ACTION-ARGS and `:text', where text
is the text response from OpenAI.

API-OPTIONS is an optional property list of options to pass to
the OpenAI API. Kebab case keys are converted to snake case JSON
keys. For example `max-tokens' becomes \"max_tokens\". The
values in API-OPTIONS are merged with and overwrite equivalent
values in the customization options specified in for example
`robby-chat-options' or `robby-completion-options'.

GROUNDING-FNS - Format the response from OpenAI before returning
it. Only used if `NEVER-STREAM-P' is t.

NO-OP-PATTERN - If the response matches this regular expression,
do not perform the action. Useful with a prompt that tells OpenAI
to respond with a certain response if there is nothing to do. For
example with a prompt of \"Fix this code. Respond with \\='the code
is correct\\=' if the code is correct\", then a NO-OP-PATTERN of
\"code is correct\" will tell robby to not replace the region
when the pattern matches. Only use NO-OP-PATTERN when
NEVER-STREAM-P is t.

NO-OP-MESSAGE - Message to display when NO-OP-PATTERN matches. Optional.

HISTORYP indicates whether or not to use conversation history.

NEVER-STREAM-P - Never stream response if t. If present this
value overrides the `robby-stream' customization variable."
